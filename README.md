# 50 Projects in 50 Days Challenge

## Day 1: Expanding Cards

This is my first project from the #50projects50days challenge, where I created interactive expanding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The expanding cards change their size and reveal more content when clicked. It's a fun way to practice frontend development and improve my coding skills.
